StockWiz is an AI-powered stock prediction website for companies listed on NASDAQ

I've made use of Alphavantage for stock history data, and used an LSTM (Long Term Short Memory) for the model.

You can add stocks to your portfolio along with the how many you want to buy. Then wait for the model to train and behold your portfolio.
At the end you can find out how much money you'd make (or lose) on these stocks! 

(Disclaimer: just for fun!)
